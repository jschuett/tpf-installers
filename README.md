## Important

Ensure that you have installed **JACK2**; for download and installation, see https://jackaudio.org/downloads/. Sometimes it is recommended to uninstall an old JACK1 or JACK2 first. You find the script ‘uninstall-jack2-tpf.command’ in the folder ‘tpf-tools-intermediate’; it only uninstalls JACK2.
