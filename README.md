# Installers for the tpf-tools v1.1.1
* **tpf-tools-basic**
* **tpf-tools-intermediate**

## Important

Make sure that you have installed **JACK2**; for download and installation see: https://jackaudio.org/downloads/. Sometimes it is recommended to uninstall an old installation of JACK1 or JACK2 first. You find the script ‘uninstall-jack2-tpf.command’ in the folder ‘tpf-tools-intermediate’; it only uninstalls JACK2.
